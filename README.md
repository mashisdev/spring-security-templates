A collection of Spring Boot projects demonstrating different user authentication strategies using **Spring Security**. This repository serves as a starting point for developers looking to implement secure and scalable authentication in their Spring applications.

1. [Simple JWT](https://github.com/mashisdev/spring-security-templates/tree/main/simple) authentication with secret key 🗝️
2. [Role-based access control (RBAC)](https://github.com/mashisdev/spring-security-templates/tree/main/roles) with USER and ADMIN managed access to API endpoints (easy implementation with `@PreAuthorize`) 👑
